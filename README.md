# Basic Programming Course Tasks

This repository contains various tasks completed during a basic programming course, primarily using console applications to apply fundamental programming concepts. The course covered:

Algorithms and Basic Computer Operations: Understanding how computers execute instructions and how algorithms work.
Decision Structures and Loops: Implementation of if, switch, while, do-while, and for loops.
Data Types and Type Conversions: Exploration of value and reference types, and type conversion techniques.
Arrays and Methods: Working with arrays, custom methods, and built-in functions.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals: Class structures, constructors, encapsulation, static variables, and methods, as well as error handling and exceptions.
Web Technologies: Basics of XML, JSON, HTML, CSS, and their roles in web development.
Advanced Programming Concepts: Recursion, inheritance, access modifiers, sorting algorithms, and data structures.
The tasks are primarily focused on console-based applications, where each task demonstrates the practical application of these concepts.
